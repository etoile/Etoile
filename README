Etoile 0.4
==========

Etoile intends to be an innovative GNUstep based user environnement built from
the ground up on highly modular and light components with project and document
orientation in mind, in order to allow users to create their own workflow by
reshaping or recombining provided Services (aka Applications), Components etc.
Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code level should allow us
to scale from PDA to computer environment.

Various licenses are used, they are specific to each module, but BSD and MIT 
licenses are the most widely used. Apache, LGPL and even more rarely GPL 
licenses are in used in few modules too.

repository and run tests suites:

    * make test=yes 

    * make check (not yet implemented)


Dependency
----------

Unless you only build Cocoa compatible modules on Mac OS X, you have to install
GNUstep, this is the only mandatory dependency. To set up GNUstep with its
related dependencies, you should read about GNUstep install on
<http://www.gnustep.org>

    * From GNUstep: gnustep-make, gnustep-base, gnustep-gui, gnustep-back

    * From Freedesktop: D-Bus, HAL, startup-notification, Xcursor

    * libpng, zlib, OniGuruma, XScreenSaver, LLVM, GMP, Lemon, PostgreSQL, 
      OSS, FFmpeg (libavcodec and libavformat), TagLib, MPEG4IP (libmp4v2)

More details about Etoile dependencies can be found in INSTALL document (in the
